# MultiLink

This is the MultiLink data visualization app for the Multinet project.
It is an interactive node-link diagram, written in TypeScript using the Vue.js framework,
that allows users to visualize network data hosted on a Multinet instance.

1. Ensure that you have Node and yarn installed.
2. Check out this repository and move into it (e.g., `cd multilink`).
3. Copy .env.development to .env with `cp .env.default .env`.
4. Install the Yarn dependencies: `yarn install`.
5. Run the application: `yarn serve`.
