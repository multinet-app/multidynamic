# MultiDynamic

This is the MultiDynamic data visualization app for the Multinet project.
It is an interactive node-link diagram for dynamic network data, written in TypeScript using the Vue.js framework,
that allows users to visualize network data hosted on a Multinet instance.

## Quick Start

To get the application up and running in dev mode:

1. Ensure that you have Node and yarn installed.
2. Check out this repository and move into it (e.g., `cd multidynamic`).
3. Copy .env.development to .env with `cp .env.default .env`.
4. Install the Yarn dependencies: `yarn install`.
5. Run the application: `yarn serve`.
